Twitch TV
- A Free Code Camp front-end challenge, checks if the pre-defined content authors are currently online (or offline) and the content being streamed.
- Implemented in vanilla JavaScript, using the standard JS coding style.
- Adopted a clean and minimalist style; tinkered with CSS grid.
- JavaScript code needs to be refactored, to reduce repetitive code. Will likely redesign the implemented approach on this challenge as I further my studies on (vanilla) JavaScript fundamentals.

Resources used:
- Bootstrap CSS
- Twitch TV API
