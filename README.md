Twitch TV
- A Free Code Camp front-end challenge, checks if the pre-defined content authors are currently online (or offline) and the corresponding content being streamed.
- Implemented in vanilla JavaScript, using the standard JS coding style.
- Adopted a clean and minimalist style; tinkered with CSS grid.
- Note (to myself): JavaScript code needs to be refactored, to reduce repetitive code; likely to redesign the implemented approach on this challenge as my studies on (vanilla) JavaScript fundamentals progresses.

Resources used:
- Bootstrap CSS
- Twitch TV API
